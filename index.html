        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I come from an interdisciplinary background that bridges engineering, public service education, and the study of law. My early training as a Civil Engineer instilled in me a strong foundation in problem-solving and practical thinking, which I further honed during my four years as an educator and mentor for Civil Services aspirants. Working closely with candidates from diverse social and regional backgrounds gave me a deep appreciation of India's structural disparities—an awareness that now shapes my legal perspective.</p>
        <p>At law school, my previous experiences have gained structure and clarity. Legal education has sharpened my critical thinking, refined my writing, and strengthened my ability to work under pressure—whether through academic rigour or demanding corporate internships. I am particularly drawn to areas where technology, regulatory frameworks, and public interest intersect, including commercial contracts, privacy law, and international legal systems.</p>
        <p>I believe my engineering background complements my legal training by offering a unique lens for analysis and systems thinking. As I approach graduation, I aim to contribute meaningfully in fields that value both legal insight and multidisciplinary fluency.</p>

                    <h3>Digital Bailment</h3>
                    <p>This research paper explores the concept of digital bailment, an evolving legal framework situated at the intersection of traditional bailment principles and modern digital realities. While bailment traditionally applies to tangible assets, this paper investigates the legal viability of extending bailment doctrines to intangible assets such as electronic data. It critically analyzes key U.S. court decisions and draws parallels with Indian jurisprudence, particularly the Supreme Court’s ruling in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India regarding Aadhaar data retention.</p>

                    <h3>Related Party Transactions: Evaluating Audit Committees' Role and Arm's Length Application</h3>
                    <p>This paper critically examines the legal framework surrounding Related Party Transactions (RPTs) in India, focusing on the Companies Act, 2013. It highlights their potential for exploitation, especially involving promoters and their families, and the regulatory challenges in ensuring transparency and accountability. It examines audit committee roles, conflict of interest issues, and ambiguous definitions around 'arm’s length' and 'ordinary course of business'.</p>

                    <h3>Extension of Schedule Six Provisions to the Hill Areas of Manipur</h3>
                    <p>This paper explores the democratic and identity-based rationale for extending Sixth Schedule provisions to Manipur’s hill areas. It argues for democratic decentralization in light of ethnic diversity, regional demands for autonomy, and lessons from Northeast India's governance structure.</p>
