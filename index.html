    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I come from an interdisciplinary background that bridges engineering, public service education, and the study of law.
      My early training as a Civil Engineer instilled in me a strong foundation in problem-solving and practical thinking, which I further honed during my four years as an educator and mentor for Civil Services aspirants.
      Working closely with candidates from diverse social and regional backgrounds gave me a deep appreciation of India's structural disparitiesâ€”an awareness that now shapes my legal perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      At law school, my previous experiences have gained structure and clarity.
      Legal education has sharpened my critical thinking, refined my writing, and strengthened my ability to work under pressureâ€”whether through academic rigour or demanding corporate internships.
      I am particularly drawn to areas where technology, regulatory frameworks, and public interest intersect, including commercial contracts, privacy law, and international legal systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe my engineering background complements my legal training by offering a unique lens for analysis and systems thinking.
      As I approach graduation, I aim to contribute meaningfully in fields that value both legal insight and multidisciplinary fluency.
    </p>
